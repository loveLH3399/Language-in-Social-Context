# Language-in-Social-Context
<i>Bridging NLP and Sociolinguistics</i>

<b>Area:</b> Language and Computation (LaCo)

<b>Level:</b> Introductory

<b>Lecturer(s):</b> Agnieszka Faleńska and Filip Miletić

<b>Abstract:</b>
This course explores the relationship between language and society by drawing on complementary perspectives from sociolinguistics and natural language processing. It discusses variation in language use in connection with 
- (i) speakers’ sociodemographic properties such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status; 
- (ii) speakers’ patterns of interaction; and 
- (iii) the social meaning conveyed through the use of different linguistic variants. 

In bringing together NLP and sociolinguistics, we aim to establish a comparable level of depth across the disciplines. <br>
- For students already acquainted with fundamental computational linguistics, the course will provide insights into the richness of language when viewed within a broader social context.
- For students with a background in sociolinguistics, we will present examples of various computational techniques that can be used to analyze linguistic variation.
- Students with previous experience in programming will be able to run the practical exercises independently and engage with different types of attested linguistic data.

# Pre-requirements
<b> Basic Python Knowledge:</b> [Python tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) <br>
<b> Python Installation: </b> [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Virtual Enivironment Setup
<i> To install the packages used for this project. </i> Run the commands in the terminal.
- Step1: Install  ``` pip install virtualenv ``` 
- Step2: Run the command(replace the <version> with your version and <virtual-environment-name> with your choice of name) ```python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name> ``` <br>
Example: ``` python -m venv my_venv ```
- Step3: Activate the Virtual env ```source my_venv/bin/activate```
<br>Note: We will be installing all the packages to <b>my_venv</b> environment and using it further to run the code.
